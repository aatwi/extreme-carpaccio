## DO
_`What did we do?`_

08/20/2020
- Setup for the Carpaccio kata  
- Installed NPM on Ahmad's machine
- Wrote the tasks in a trello board
- Wrote code for a feature to compute the amount for hungary wit less than 1000 euros
- We used the Spring Boot application 

08/27/2020
- Continued
- Difficult to catch up at the beginning
- a lot of time spent on error handling
- time spent on adjusting team dynamics

09/03/2020
- Continued
- all countries
- some ranges (we still don't handle between 1K and 10K, looks to be most common orders)
- inserted a bug with integer division 
- Went faster this time

## LEARN
_`What did we learn?`_

08/20/2020
- First time to facilitate 
- 2 hours is too short for this kata 
- We might need to use a full day for this kata if we want to cover all the cases 
- 1/2 day is required at least 
- Facilitator needs to be prepare for this in order not to waste of time 

08/27/2020
- We need more than a 2 hours session to make it effective (time to setup, not losing the momentum)
- looks like a promising kata
- Gamification is cool

09/03/2020
- Careful when reusing same constants / implementation in tests and in code
- Makes sense to have at least 1 hard-coded value in a test
- Dealing with errors and exceptions can take a long time

## PUZZLE
_`What still puzzles us?`_

08/20/2020
- External coaches cannot run this on their machines due to the IP port blockage 

08/27/2020
- Is it normal to spend a lot of time on error handling when dealing with a service?
- Tricky to split 5 minutes round robin between coding / design ...
- Is gamification a way to do asynchronous, self-service technical coaching?

09/03/2020
- wouldn't this kata encourage dirty code?
   - is it something to train?
   - start playing with bad inputs to see what happens?
   - give rules one after the other, to force adaptation?
   - a sonar server? Quality gate?
   - TODO for tech debt?
   - Change rules during the game?

## DECIDE
_`How can we apply this in the future?`_

08/20/2020
- If we need to run it at large scale, we might consider having a VM where all coaches can have access to it
- We can consider running it again with Philippe and Patrice (in group mode)
- Patrice could not have his IntelliJ working :(
   - it's not a straightforward env

08/27/2020
- Patrice to setup his IntelliJ env
- Might need to look into the setup to make it effective
- Let's continue for 1 more session, there is more from a coaching point of view

09/03/2020
- Let's stop there!
- Idea: organize a 4h jam with Murex devs to learn how to best use this kata
