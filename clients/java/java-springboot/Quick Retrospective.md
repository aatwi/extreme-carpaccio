## DO
_`What did we do?`_

- Setup for the Carapaccio kata  
- Installed NPM on AHmad's mcahine
- Wrote the tasks in a trello board
- Wrote code for a feature to compute amount for hungary wit less than 1000 euros
- We used the Spring Boot application 

## LEARN
_`What did we learn?`_

- First time to facilitate 
- 2 hours is too short for this kata 
- We might need to use a full day for this kata if we want to cover all the cases 
- 1/2 day is required at least 
- Facilitator needs to be prepare for this in order not to waste of time 

## PUZZLE
_`What still puzzles us?`_

- External coaches cannot run this on there machines due to the IP port blockage 
- 

## DECIDE
_`How can we apply this in the future?`_

- If we need to run it at large scale, we might consider having a VM where all coaches can have access to it
- We can consider running it again with Philippe and Patrice (in group mode)
